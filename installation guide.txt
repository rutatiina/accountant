NOTE:
All resources are already included in the package (Apart from items images resources).
So no need to publish.

Run the following command to setup;
  composer create-project rutatiina/accountant [folder-name]
  cd [folder-name]
  php artisan storage:link
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag="rutatiina/item" --force
